# Flight playback animation

Replay flight tracks on a map and save animation as a mp4 movie with Python framework (geo/moving/pandas, contextily...)

Flight data are managed with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) / [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) / [movingpandas](https://pypi.org/project/movingpandas/)

The map background is built with [contextily](https://github.com/darribas/contextily)

Visualization and animation are realized with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/index.html)



## Running the tests

Run the demo-flight-playback notebook to see how to build an animation from a recorded flight (Marrakesh-Rome)

## Built With

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Python Data Analysis Library

* [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) - GeoPandas is an open source project which extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. 

* [movingpandas](https://pypi.org/project/movingpandas/) - Implementation of Trajectory classes and functions built on top of GeoPandas

* [contextily](https://github.com/darribas/contextily) - Context geo-tiles in Python

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/index.html) - Python 2D plotting library
